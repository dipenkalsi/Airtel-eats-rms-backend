# Airtel eats Restaurant management System
This is the project I created during my internship @airtel. It is an online food-ordering service which uses Java, Springboot, Hibernate, MySQL etc. The project supports the following functionalities:
- __User authentication and authorization using JWT and Spring security__: External users can register as a Customer or Restaurant owner. Additionally, this app also supports the role of a _Super admin_ for select internal users, who are assigned the task to moderate the activities on the platform.
- __CRUD Operations on Restaurant__: Restaurant owners can create, update and delete restaurant information using the app. Customers can search and view restaurant information (both by name and cuisine) and also add a restaurant into favorites.
